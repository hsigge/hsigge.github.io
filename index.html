    <h1>Hanna Sigge</h1>
    <h2>Communications expert with a specialism in team and life coaching</h2>
        <p>Now doing programming: since I am quite lazy I hate working more than I have to on boring chores. 
        That's why my main hobby in life is home organization, couples with a dash of minimalism.</p>
        <p>Who knows what the combination with bring - marketing &amp; communications, home organization, and web programming. 
            An app that cleans the house, walks the dog and keeps the kids on their toes, perhaps? </p>
