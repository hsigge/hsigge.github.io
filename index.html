            <h2>Communications expert with a specialism in team and life coaching</h2>
            <p>Since I am quite lazy I hate working more than I have to on boring chores. 
            That's why my main hobby in life is home organization, couples with a dash of minimalism.</p>
            <p>Now doing programming. Who knows what the combination with bring - marketing &amp; communications, home organization, and web programming. 
            An app that cleans the house, walks the dog, calls your mum, and keeps the kids on their toes, perhaps?
